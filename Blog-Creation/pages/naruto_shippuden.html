            The first series is brought to a close by the end of Sasuke and
            Naruto's friendship. The young ninjas clash after the Academy tracks
            Sasuke down. Powered by the substances that the Sound Four have
            given him, Sasuke is much stronger than he was when he ran away from
            the Academy. The incredibly intense fight forces Naruto to call upon
            the beast trapped inside of him. Even so, he is overpowered by
            Sasuke. Though he does not wish to be foiled by any further attacks
            from Naruto, Sasuke ultimately spares his former friend's life. He
            feels that killing his unconcious friend would make him too much
            like his brother. In a symbolic gesture, he leaves the head
            protector he wore at the Academy by Naruto's body. In the background
            of all this, there are looming attacks from rogue leaders and the
            secret organization called Akatsuki. Knowing that the potential for
            global war is brewing, and that Naruto will have to get much
            stronger to face the coming threat, a renowned ninja named Jiraiya
            takes Naruto out of the academy for personal training. The timeline
            jumps forward several years between the end of Naruto and the
            beginning of Shippuden. The series begins with an older Naruto
            returning to the academy and we learn the progress of his friends.
            The trio at the center of the series are all training under
            legendary ninjas in individualized programs. Sakura has become an
            incredible healer, Naruto's abilities are much improved, and Sasuke
            is still on the run under the tutelage of the disgraced shinobi
            Orochimaru. The new series deals with the older ninjas fighting
            against the growing forces of the Akatsuki, who stage bolder and
            bolder attacks on various cities as cover to attempt to steal the
            sealed beast powers that a small class of fighters like Naruto
            possess. At the same time, the series offers a resolution to
            Sasuke's years-long quest to exact vengeance on his brother. Sasuke
            finds his brother and they engage in a long, drawn-out battle that
            features several feints and mind projections. Using their illusory
            ninjitsu abilities, the brothers go through several battles that end
            in gruesome and psychedelic ways, only for it to be revealed that
            the battle has yet to start outside of their minds.
